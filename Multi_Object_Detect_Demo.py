# Image Object Detection Using Tensorflow-trained Classifier #
#
# Author: Zack Tuttle
# Date: 7/8/19
# Description:
# This program uses Tensorflow Object Detection to detect a cursor in a given
# desktop image.

# Some of the code is copied from Google's example at
# https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/object_detection_tutorial.ipynb

# and some is copied from Dat Tran's example at
# https://github.com/datitran/object_detector_app/blob/master/object_detection_app.py

# the meat of the code was provided by youtuber EdjeElectronics
# https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API-Tutorial-Train-Multiple-Objects-Windows-10/blob/master/Object_detection_image.py

# partial crop code modified using this stackoverflow post
